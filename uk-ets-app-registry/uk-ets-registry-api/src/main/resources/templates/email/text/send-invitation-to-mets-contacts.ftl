Dear ${contactFullName},

You are being sent this email as you are a contact in the UK ETS METS system.

A new Operator account has now been opened for you in the UK ETS Registry, and the account details are as follows:

Operator Name: ${operatorName}
Account Type: ${accountType}
Registry Account Number: ${registryAccountNumber}
Emitter ID: ${emitterId}

Your account has been configured such that you only need to appoint one Authorised Representative in order to surrender allowances to meet your UK ETS obligations.

Actions you need to complete

If you have received this email during the period 1st February – 30th April, and you have a requirement to surrender allowances by the 30th of April, you must complete these instructions as a matter of urgency.

In order for the Registry account to be managed, the account must be claimed and an Authorised Representative appointed to it.

THE CLAIM ACCOUNT CODE FOR THIS ACCOUNT IS: ${accountClaimCode}

To claim the account, your proposed Authorised Representative must:

1. Create a Registry sign in (if they have not already done so) by navigating to the home page of the UK ETS Registry and selecting ‘Create sign in’.
2. Log in to the UK ETS Registry.
3. Navigate to ‘Accounts’ at the top of the page.
4. Select ‘Claim account’.
5. Enter the claim account code shown above.
6. Enter the METS Registry ID which can be found in the METS system.

Please consider nominating yourself as an Authorised Representative, so that there is a single point of contact for both UK ETS METS and Registry matters.

Please note that the claim account code provided in this email may have been sent to more than one contact we have for this operator. However, it can only be used by one person at a time to claim the account.

Once the account has been successfully claimed, a member of the Registry team will contact you to request any supporting documentation we may require in order to complete the appointment of your Authorised Representative.

Important information

You are entitled to nominate one Authorised Representative (with Surrender Only permission) for your Operator account free of charge, as this is included in the Emissions Monitoring Plan/Permit Application fee charged by your regulator.

By default, your nominated Authorised Representative will be given the Surrender Only permission. This will enable your nominated Authorised Representative to complete their compliance actions in the Registry.

The Surrender Only permission allows an Authorised Representative to complete a Surrender transaction only. A Return of Allocation transaction is also possible if this is required.

They will not be able to perform any other type of transaction or make amendments to the Trusted Account List.

Changes to an Authorised Representative’s permissions may be requested with the Registry after the initial appointment has been completed. We will request additional supporting documentation as part of this process and additional fees will be charged.

If you wish to have extra Authorised Representatives, you will be charged for each addition. The amount you will need to pay is detailed in Section 17 of our charging scheme which can be found at:
Environment Agency (greenhouse gas emissions) charging scheme - GOV.UK
https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-greenhouse-gas-emissions-charging-scheme-2021

If you need to purchase UK ETS allowances to meet your UK ETS surrender obligation, you can do this before the first Authorised Representative is appointed.

You will need to give your supplier the Registry Account Number set out above so they can arrange for your allowances to be delivered into the account.

You can find details of suppliers in the UK ETS Registry Public Reports:
UK Emissions Trading Registry - GOV.UK
https://reports.view-emissions-trading-registry.service.gov.uk/ets-reports.html

There are transaction delays within the Registry that may affect the delivery of allowances from your supplier to your account. It is your responsibility to ensure that sufficient allowances are delivered into your Operator account in time to surrender them by 11:59pm UK Time (UTC+1) on 30th April.

If you have any questions regarding the claiming of your account or appointment of your Authorised Representatives, please contact us at ${etrAddress}

Kind regards,

The Registry Team
