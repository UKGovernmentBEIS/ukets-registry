Dear UK ETS Registry User,  
<p>
On ${initiationDate}, we requested a payment of   
${amount} for Registry task ID ${requestId} for ${description}.
<p>

<p>  
It appears that that this amount has not yet been paid.
</p>
<p>   
Can you please arrange for this payment to be made as soon as possible. We   
cannot complete any application or task linked to this payment until it has been   
paid in full. Failure to make the required payment could delay your application   
or the application may be deemed withdrawn.   
</p>

<p>
Details of how to make the payment can be found on the original payment request.
</p>

<p>   
If you think the payment has already been made or you have a query about the   
payment request, please contact the UK ETS Registry helpdesk on <a href="mailto: ${etrAddress}">${etrAddress}</a>.
