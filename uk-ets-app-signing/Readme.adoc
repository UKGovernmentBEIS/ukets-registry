= Tx Signing - PoC
:toc:

== Intro

An Spring Boot backend app to sing registry data using Vault's Transits engine


== Running

This Spring Boot application can be started by `mvn spring-boot:run` or by starting the SignignApplication's main method.

It exposes two http endpoints

.  /api-signing/sign to sign data

. /api-signing/verify to verify the signed data

== Initial vault configuration for signing

Initial setup has been performed using the Vault UI. The setup can also be performed with a CLI
command or an API call, which would be most useful for automating configuration.

TIP: Instructions are here for reference only, since the setup is already automated in the
custom docker image prepared in uk-ets-vault repository.

==== Enable the 'Transit' engine

Go to the Secrets menu and Press Enable new engine

Select the 'Transit' engine

Hit Next, name it 'ukets-transit-engine' and Press 'Enable Engine'

==== Create a new encryption key that supports signing

Enter the newly created 'ukets-transit-engine' and Select 'Create encryption key'

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-09-43-876.png[width=940]

Name the key sign-key and select 'ed25519' type from the Type dropdown menu. This key type supports signing.

==== Create a new policy

From the Policies menu on the top select 'Create ACL policy'

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-11-57-532.png[width=940]

Name the policy 'ukets-transit-engine-policy' and paste the following code into the policy window.


[source, javascript]
path "ukets-transit-engine/*" {
  capabilities = [ "update" ]
}

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-14-08-496.png[width=940]

This path will allow the policy to sign using all keys that are created under the ukets-transit-engine.
The actual paths for signing is ukets-transit-engine/sign/sign-key and for
verification uket-transit-engine/verify/sign-key

TIP: Signing keys need to have the 'update' capability, the read capability as 'read' capability only allows reading
e.g secrets and it is not appropriate for signing.


==== Enable AppRole authentication method

The following section is based on the official https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/identity/authentication[AppRole Pull Authentication] guide
at the Vault website.

After logging to the vault UI and from the top menu select access and press 'Enable new method'

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-05-51-302.png[width=940]

Select AppRole method and press Next

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-06-49-842.png[width=940]

Leave the Path name 'approle' and hit Enable Method

==== Create a role for the signing application

Open the vault browser from the right side of the top level menu

image::images/image-2020-09-29-17-20-34-278.png[width=940]
Create a new role 'signing-app' and associate it with the 'ukets-transit-engile-policy'

`vault write auth/approle/role/signing-app token_policies="ukets-transit-engine-policy" token_ttl=1h token_max_ttl=4h`

Get the RoleID and Sected Id with the following commands

`vault read auth/approle/role/signing-app/role-id`

`vault write -force auth/approle/role/signing-app/secret-id`
