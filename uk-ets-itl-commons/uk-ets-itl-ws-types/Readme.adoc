Generated (Apache Axis) stubs & skeletons for the KP web services (client & server)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This project generates the common types as well as the stubs (for client side) & skeletons (server side)
for both the registry and the transaction log wsdl's.

The (re)generate of the sources is done via maven profiles:

Profile registry-build (re)generates the registry related sources: mvn clean install -Dbuild=registry

Profile transactionlog-build (re)generates the transactionlog related sources: mvn clean install -Dbuild=transactionlog
