= ClamAV shared library

== Purpose
This library acts as a central point that handles the virus scanning of a file that is uploaded through an API.

== Under the hood
The library defines a Spring Boot service that instantiates a ClamavClient instance using a server host name and a server port.

== Usage
In order to use the library in a Spring Boot application, one needs to include this dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>uk.gov.ets</groupId>
        <artifactId>uk-ets-lib-commons-clamav-service</artifactId>
        <version>${uk-ets-lib-commons.version}</version>
    </dependency>

in the pom.xml, where uk-ets-lib-commons.version the current lib-commons version.

Also in the META-INF/spring.factories file under the:

    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=

add the line

    gov.uk.ets.file.upload.services.ClamavService

and define the

    clamav.server.hostname
    clamav.server.port

properties in the application.properties file.
